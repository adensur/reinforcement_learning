Lessons learned from simple cartpole (input - provided observations, 4 numbers - coordinates and velocities)
1. value-prediction and choosing best value is unstable. It tends to short-circuit itself by always predicting the same move, quickly falling, thus minimazing the loss by always correctly predicting quick fall.
2. Relu on final layer seems to increase the chance of short-circuit
3. Exploration is important! It allows the agent to learn something from "random" policy while he is still weak himself
4. History helps prevent short-circuit as well, by remembering good examples.
